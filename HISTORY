CHANGE NOTES - 1.2

* Resource metadata is now represented as a dedicated model. Before it was a simple Map<String, String>. The model contains a list of Songs, Visuals, and an inner model for RenderingParameters.
* This is a breaking change to all previous clients that used the Metadata object on BaseResource.
